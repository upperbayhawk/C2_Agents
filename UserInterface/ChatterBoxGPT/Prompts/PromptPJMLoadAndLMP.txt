Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with seven columns. The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the Load and Price data and for the LocalLoad and LocalPrice data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum Load value and the Price at that time and the LocalLoad and LocalPrice. Store the maximum temperature using the function putSensorValueByName with the name "MaxTempForecast". Use the value you remembered as PeakLoadThreshold. If you don't remember this value, use the value 130,000 for PeakThresholdLoad. If the maximum load value is greater than PeakThresholdLoad, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the LocalLoad is greater than 3500, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". Set the LMP to the price when the Load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the Load or Price value was selected minus 1 hour and set the duration to 120 mins. If the projected_peak_datetime_ept and pjm_load_forecast in the operations report JSON data is the same as the maximun load then display "MAX LOAD CONFIRMED".
