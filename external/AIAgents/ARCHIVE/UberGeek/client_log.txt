1. **Dates and Times**:
   - `datetime_beginning_utc`: Timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   - `datetime_beginning_ept`: Corresponding timestamp in Eastern Prevailing Time (EPT).

2. **P-Node Information**:
   - `pnode_id`: A numerical identifier for p-nodes (pricing nodes on the power grid).
   - `pnode_name`: The name associated with each p-node.
   
3. **Network Attributes**:
   - `voltage`: Electrical potential level at which a p-node operates, such as '230 KV'.
   - `equipment`: Identifier or type of equipment associated with the p-node, for example, 'T-1'.
   - `type`: Categorical attribute describing the p-node type, commonly 'LOAD' indicating demand.
   - `zone`: The grid zone where the p-node is located, such as 'PSEG'.

4. **Pricing Information**:
   - `system_energy_price_da`: The day-ahead price for energy for the system as a whole.
   - `total_lmp_da`: Locational marginal price (LMP) for the day-ahead market.
   - `congestion_price_da`: Price component attributed to grid congestion for the day-ahead market.
   - `marginal_loss_price_da`: Price component associated with marginal losses for the day-ahead market.

5. **Record Status and Version**:
   - `row_is_current`: Boolean value indicating if the row's data is the current record.
   - `version_nbr`: Version number of the record, which is '1' for all entries.

Note: The data encompasses a variety of metrics important for power grid operation and pricing in a wholesale electricity market. It includes both categorical and numeric fields that provide insight into operational characteristics and financial aspects of electricity provision and consumption.
