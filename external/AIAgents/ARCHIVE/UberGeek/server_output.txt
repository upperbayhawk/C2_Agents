- `datetime_beginning_ept`: Timestamp of the data point in EPT (Eastern Prevailing Time).
- `pnode_id`: Identifier for the pricing node.
- `pnode_name`: Name of the pricing node.
- `voltage`: Voltage level at the node.
- `equipment`: Equipment identifier.
- `type`: Type of data point (e.g., LOAD).
- `zone`: Zone identifier.
- `system_energy_price_da`: Day-ahead system energy price.

- `marginal_loss_price_da`: Day-ahead marginal loss price.
- `row_is_current`: Boolean indicating if the row is the current version.
- `version_nbr`: Version number of the data point.

The dataset consists of 52 rows. Most of the fields appear to be complete, but there are 2 missing values in `voltage`, `equipment`, and `zone`.

Here are some additional statistics:
- The dataset covers 3 unique timestamps.
- There are 29 unique `pnode_name` entries, with 'FACEROCK' appearing most frequently (6 times).
- There are 8 unique voltage levels, with '230 KV' being the most common (24 instances).
- The `type` column has 3 unique values, with 'LOAD' being the most common.
- There are 12 unique zones with 'PSEG' appearing in 30 entries.
- All rows are marked as the current version (`row_is_current` is `True` for all entries).
- The `version_nbr` is `1` for all data points, indicating no version changes.

If more detailed analysis or specific queries within the data are required, please let me know how I may further assist.
